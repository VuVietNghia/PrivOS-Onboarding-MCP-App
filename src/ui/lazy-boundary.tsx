/**
 * Catches a failed lazy `import()` of a panel chunk — the browser has the
 * shell cached but the hashed chunk it references is gone (upgrade swapped
 * the installation generation, or the Hub's asset cache was flushed for a
 * generation this tab still references). React's own error boundary
 * contract is the only way to intercept a rejected dynamic import inside a
 * component tree; a plain try/catch around `React.lazy` cannot, since the
 * throw happens during render, not at call time.
 *
 * Deliberately does not retry the import itself: a stale chunk reference is
 * a shell/asset mismatch that a re-fetch of the (also stale) shell cannot
 * fix, so the fallback asks for a full reload instead.
