# CLAUDE.md

## Project

PrivOS Onboarding MCP app (position templates, per-hire roadmaps, progress; data in isolated PrivOS Lists). Node.js 22 + TypeScript + React/Vite. Direct HTTP is the
deployment default; relay WebSocket is for local development. Both use
`src/mcp-message-handlers.ts`.

## Commands

- `npm ci` — install from lockfile; the PrivOS SDKs come from the npm registry.
- `npm run dev` — relay transport with live Vite UI.
- `npm run build` — build UI, generate `dist/manifest.json`, validate schema v2, and print canonical hashes.
- `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run preflight` — required verification.
- `npm run package` — deterministic tracked-source archive; requires a clean tree (parity check only, see PUBLISHING.md §3).
- `npm run publish:marketplace` — `privos-app publish`: package, authorize, upload, version, submit in one command; see PUBLISHING.md and the `privos-app-publish` agent skill for the full flow, `--json` events, and error remediation. The skill is provided for every agent runtime — `.claude/skills/`, `.privos/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, and `.gemini/skills/` (identical `privos-app-publish/SKILL.md` + `references/errors.md`).
- `npm run docker:build` — isolated marketplace image build.

## Invariants

- `privos-app.json` is the canonical Marketplace/runtime manifest; package identity fields mirror it.
- Do not add manifest fields outside `MARKETPLACE_MANIFEST_FIELDS` without Portal parser support.
- Every declared permission needs a real annotated call site and a `SCOPES.md` justification; every optional permission needs safe degraded behavior.
- Production uses the workload broker/DPoP SDK and signed private dispatch. Legacy relay credentials are development-only.
- The iframe never receives a Hub bearer/user token; backend actor identity comes from the verified dispatch assertion.
- Never package or build from a working-tree sweep; never commit secrets.
